A digital landmark to share some of my interests, passions, and projects.

-- Matthew:
-- I really liked your homepage, it's simple, to the point, and its headers are direct to the content below.  I would have liked to see more images in this page though, I think visuals are really beneficial to content.  

-- I love the changing text, you'll have to show me that some time 

-- My last comment for the homepage is I think if you have links which don't go anywhere, it might be safe to remove them for now, or have a simple coming soon page set up for them.  

-- Resume page looks great!

-- I don't really know how your main.js file in your assets folder is working to be honest.  It seems some of the content is not completed yet to be used, or I'm missing something.  Either way I like your comments on it to show what is supposed to happen at each function, which is much appreciated.
